# Using Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a classification machine algorithm for variables that follow a linear distribution. Here, we will to use the Logistic Regression Pharo implementation to determine if someone has or has not diabetes based on their physical condition.

We will use data from the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) to train the machine learning to be able to predict if someone has or not diabetes based in several parameters.

To make this exercise, we will follow a workflow. First, we need to do all the steps for preprocessing the data. After we have the data all set, we train the machine learning model to finally measure its accuracy.

## Preprocessing the data

In Pharo, we have a library for loading several dataset directly into Pharo as DataFrame objects: [Pharo Datasets](https://github.com/pharo-ai/Datasets). It contains the well-know examples like the [iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) and several other ones. Feel free to inspect the available datasets. Here we will use a dataset from the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) for predicting if a patient has or not diabetes.

First we need to install the library using the [Metacello script](https://github.com/pharo-ai/Datasets) available in the README. The method `loadXXX` will return a [DataFrame object](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame).

[Pharo DataFrame](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame) can be seen as the Pharo equivalent of [Python Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

```st
"Loading the dataset"
diabetesPima := AIDatasets loadDiabetesPima.
```

Now, for training our model, we need at least two partitions of the dataset: one for training and the other for measuring the accuracy of the model. Also in Pharo, we have a small library to help you with that task! [Random Partitioner](https://github.com/pharo-ai/random-partitioner). The library first random shuffle the data and then partition it with the given proportions. This library is already included by default when you load the [Pharo Datasets](https://github.com/pharo-ai/Datasets) or [Pharo DataFrame](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame). So, you do not need to install it again. We will partition our data into two sets: training and test with a proportion of 75%-25%.

```st
"Dividing into test and training"
partitioner := AIRandomPartitioner new.
subsets := partitioner split: diabetesPima withProportions: #(0.75 0.25).
diabetesPimaTrainDF := subsets first.
diabetesPimaTestDF := subsets second.
```

As a next step, we can separate the features between X and Y. That means: into the independent variables `X` and the dependent variable `Y`. As we have the data loaded in a DataFrame object, we can select the desire columns.

If we inspect `diabetesPima columnNames` we will see all the columns that the data has: `('Pregnancies' 'Glucose' 'BloodPressure' 'SkinThickness' 'Insulin' 'BMI' 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction' 'Age' 'Outcome')`. Where `Outcome` is the dependent variable and all the rest are the independent ones.

The method `DataFrame>>columns:` will return a new DataFrame with the specify columns.

```st
"Separating between X and Y"
diabetesPimaTrainDF columnNames. "an OrderedCollection('Pregnancies' 'Glucose' 'BloodPressure' 'SkinThickness' 'Insulin' 'BMI' 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction' 'Age' 'Outcome')"

xTrain := diabetesPimaTrainDF columns: #('Pregnancies' 'Glucose' 'BloodPressure' 'SkinThickness' 'Insulin' 'BMI' 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction' 'Age').
yTrain := diabetesPimaTrainDF column: 'Outcome'.

xTest := diabetesPimaTestDF columns: #('Pregnancies' 'Glucose' 'BloodPressure' 'SkinThickness' 'Insulin' 'BMI' 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction' 'Age').
yTest := diabetesPimaTestDF column: 'Outcome'.
```

Now we have everything that we need to start training our machine learning model!

## Training the machine learning model

The API for both the logistic and linear regression is the same. You can load the logistic regression from the [pharo-ai linear-models](https://github.com/pharo-ai/linear-models) repository.

The linear models (logistic and linear regression) accept only a `SequenceableCollection` (For now, we are working on making it compatible with DataFrame). We need to convert the DataFrame to an array. Which is quite easy, we only send the message `asArray` or `asArrayOfRows`.

```st
"Converting the DataFrame into an array of arrays For using it in the linar model.
For now, the linear model does not work on a DataFrame."
xTrain := xTrain asArrayOfRows.
yTrain := yTrain asArray.

xTest := xTest asArrayOfRows.
yTest := yTest asArray.
```

We are set. Now we proceed to train the model.

```st
"Training the logistic regression model"
logisticRegression := AILogisticRegression
	learningRate: 0.1
	maxIterations: 5000.

logisticRegression fitX: xTrain y: yTrain.
```

If you try to run all the code that we wrote until now, you most likely saw an exception with the message: `The model is starting to diverge. Try setting up a smaller learning rate or normalizing your data.` It is normal! Usually, a model starts to diverge when the data is not normalized or the learning rate is too high. In this case is because the data is not normalized.

## About normalization

### What is normalization?

In statistics and machine learning, normalization is the process which transforms multiple columns of a dataset to make them numerically consistent with each other (e.g. be on the same scale) but in the same time preserve the valuable information stored in these columns.

For example, we have a table that the Salaries that a person earns according to some criteria. The values of variable Years since PhD are in the range of `[1 .. 56]` and the salaries `[57,800 .. 231,545]`. If we plot the two variables we see:

<img src="img/normalization_comparison.png"  width=650 height=350 alt="Source: https://blog.oleks.fr/normalization">

So, the big difference between the range of the values can affect out model.

If you want to read more about normalization Oleks has a [nice blog post](https://blog.oleks.fr/normalization) about it.
>Part of the text for explaining normalization were extracted from that post.

For normalizing our data, DataFrame has a simple API: we just call the `DataFrame >> normalized` method that returns a new DataFrame that has been normalized. This method uses the default normalizer that is the min max normalizer. If you want to use another one you can use the method `DataFrame >> normalized: aNormalizerClass` instead.

So, we just execute this part **before** partitioning the data.

```st
"Normalizing the data frames"
normalizedDF := diabetesPima normalized.
```

Pay attention, now, as we want to use the normalized data, in the partitioning part we need to use the `normalizedDF` variable instead of the `diabetesPima`.

```st
subsets := partitioner split: normalizedDF withProportions: #(0.75 0.25).
```

Now, if we train the model with the normalized data we will see that everything runs smoothly! Also, as all the data is in the range of [0, 1] we can use a bigger learning rate. We experimented and we saw that with a learning rate of `1` the model converges faster and has the same accuracy.

```st
"Training the logistic regression model"
logisticRegression := AILogisticRegression
	learningRate: 1
	maxIterations: 5000.

logisticRegression fitX: xTrain y: yTrain.
```

## Measuring the accuracy and other metrics of the model

We have our model trained. But now we want to see how our model it is performing.
We will use statistical metrics to measure our model!

Yes, in Pharo we also have a library for that also: [Machine learning metrics](https://github.com/pharo-ai/metrics).
As usual, just install the library running the Metacello script from the README.

Now, we want to make predictions with our model. We want to predict if someone has diabetes or not. We will use the `training dataset` which contains new data that the model has not seen before.

For making a prediction we send the message `predict:` with the training dataset as an argument.

```st
yPredicted := logisticRegression predict: xTest.
```

Now, as we have also the real values for the data. We will measure what is the accuracy of the predictions.

```st
"Computing the accuracy of the logistic regression model"
metric := AIAccuracyScore new.
accuracy "0.7916666666666666" := (metric computeForActual: yTest predicted: yPredicted) asFloat.
```

As we can see, our model has a accuracy of **79%**. That means, the model predicted correctly if 8 out of 10 people have diabetes.

## Workflow summary

You can run the following script in a Pharo image to get all the result that we discussed above.
Do not forget to install the libraries!
